title: "Week 7: Exam Week"
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily, I didn’t have a bunch of other exams and projects due this week along with Thursday’s first exam.  I did have an interview on Monday with my dream company, which I had been super nervous about, so it was a little difficult to focus during class.  It was my first technical coding interview ever, so I definitely felt pressure.  The questions were easier than I expected, given that I expected them to ask me something I had never heard of.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first exam wasn’t too bad, but I freaked out so I don’t think I did too well.  Overall it was pretty straight forward, and it definitely helped to review the code from class and practice writing our own code before the exam.  My advice would be to study what’s emphasized in class, in our case, iterators.  One of our classmates posted an amazing notes sheet for the exam, which I think a lot of other students also ended up using, so check Piazza because you can find useful resources!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of our classmates did a good job recounting Wednesday’s lecture, which ended on an entertaining note.  Downing used an analogy to help us understand pointers and constant pointers. Here’s the link to Jerry’s blog entry with more details.

**Tip of the Week**
Someone had recommended YouTube videos by thenewboston when I first started coding, to clarify coding and Java concepts.  Little did I know, he also has videos in C++!  I found watching the videos useful in clarifying concepts I wasn’t confident in.  I recommend taking a look at them, especially if you have less experience in programming.
