title: "Week 10: Open Source and Pursuing My Passion"
---
What’s your passion? What do you love about coding?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion has always involved helping others.  Starting in high school, I spent part of my summers going to inner city Houston, Camp Barnabas, and rural Mexico where we volunteered by helping lead activities for underprivileged children, gave one-on-one care to mentally and/or physically disabled kids and their siblings, and providing health care.  My college courses fueled my desire to help others as we discussed the moral and ethical dilemmas we face in our decisions as a society.  Out of college, I served as an AmeriCorps member for my first job.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, I remembered hearing about an organization called Code for America, so I decided to look into it a bit.  [Code for America] (http://www.codeforamerica.org/) works on open-source projects so governments can use technology to make “government services simple, effective, and easy to use.”  It has city ‘Brigades’ which work on local government projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After discovering [Open Austin] (http://www.open-austin.org/), Austin’s Brigade, I found that there are many open source project online.  I kept seeing the words “open source” during my research on various companies.  On Wednesday, Conrad Stoll from [Mutual Mobile] (http://www.mutualmobile.com/) (who also happens to be my friend/former teammate’s brother, small world haha) gave a presentation focused on open source projects (check some of them out [here] (https://github.com/mutualmobile)).  He gave examples of some of the things that they worked on and made available as open source for others to use.  The amount of creativity and innovation that results from open source projects is impressive, and there’s so much you can learn from even just looking at them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal for remaining duration of my degree is to get involved in an open source project with Open Austin.  Programming is allowing me to contribute to causes I care about in ways I couldn’t before.  Technology is the future, and there are so many good things we can do with our skills. I hope that I will always remember to do meaningful work with the skills I develop.

**Tip of the Week**   
Try contributing to some open source projects!  Find out what you’re passionate about and find a way to pursue it with code!
