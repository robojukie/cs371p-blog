title: "Week Two: Estimate Time to Completion"
---
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monday I forgot my lunch at home.  Normally, if this happened I'd just forget about it and stay on campus, but this time I really wanted to go get my lunch.  It takes the bus about forty minutes round-trip and I had an hour left.  If I rushed, I'd be able to go home, eat quickly, and hurry back in time for class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the getting back in time for class didn't happen and I ended up missing the first quiz of the semester.  Of course I was annoyed with myself, but it also reminded me that sometimes things don’t go as planned and it’s good to leave some room for error.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this relevant?  The first step in our first project is to "estimate time to completion."  Even though this may seem like a trivial step, something I've learned from my past internships is that someone always wants to know how long it will take to finish your task.  People have said it’s better to overestimate how much time something will take than underestimate, so that you will always deliver by when you said you would.  This seems to hold true especially in programming, where you don’t know what kind of bug you’ll run into and how long it may take to fix.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our first project due soon, we had to set up some tools.  Even though I started early, I ran into some issues and decided to just ssh into the lab machines.  It bugs me that I don’t have it working on my computer, but I also have to realize that working on the project is more important than spending hours on what’s gone wrong.

**Tip of the week**
It was helpful to read over the project requirements and try to get started before class, then listen to Downing go over them in class.  For me it clarified some steps.  Also, sometimes when you’re stuck, it’s better to just let it go and wait for an answer (when you're expecting one).
